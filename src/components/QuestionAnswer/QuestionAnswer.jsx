        props are read-only but State changes can be asynchronous.
        Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument but State holds information about the components.Props are used to communicate between components but States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.Props make components reusable but State cannot make components reusable.

        useState is a one kind of React Hook.It allows user to add state to a functional component.t returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it.
        It works by: Checking if the current index has a value in the state, if not set the default. Then build the setter for the current state index value. Finally increment the index (for the next Hook) and return the setter and current value.

        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
